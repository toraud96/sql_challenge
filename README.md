# sql-challenge
So I was able to do the work. I tried doing the bonus! I know I could've completed it but...for some reason on the jupyter notebook 'salary' in the 'Salaries' table was not considered numerical. I tried going back to the database...kept making small changes, but nothing! I'm so curios to figure out why it didn't work out.
